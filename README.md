# Welcome to my Github!
I'm Dan, a Computer Science student at University of California, Los Angeles.

As someone with a zeal for problem-solving, I love tackling new challenges and learning modern technologies to overcome them. 
My main inspiration for projects comes from things from my day-to-day life or things I love, such as making a Pokedex to celebrate 
the remake of my favorite Pokemon game! My hope is that people are inspired by my work to create things mirroring what they love in their lives.
